# 🔍 Real-Time PCB Defect Detection System

An industrial-grade automated quality control solution utilizing **YOLOv8** for high-precision defect detection, served via a **FastAPI** backend and an interactive **Streamlit** frontend.

## 📌 Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of manual inspection in PCB manufacturing. By leveraging the **DeepPCB dataset**, the system identifies six common defect types with high accuracy and real-time inference speeds. The architecture is decoupled: a high-performance **FastAPI** server handles the deep learning computations, while a sleek **Streamlit** web interface provides a user-friendly experience for operators.

### **Defect Classes Detected:**
* Missing Hole
* Mouse Bite
* Open Circuit
* Short Circuit
* Spur
* Spurious Copper

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Decoupled Architecture:** Scalable **FastAPI** backend and a responsive **Streamlit** frontend.
* **Batch Processing:** Upload and analyze multiple PCB images simultaneously.
* **Real-Time Visualization:** Annotated results with colored bounding boxes and confidence labels.
* **Detailed Analytics:** Automatic generation of a **Confidence Table** (defect counts, class names, and raw coordinates).
* **Data Portability:** Export all processed images and data reports in a single **ZIP file** for audit trails.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a modern **Client-Server model**:
1.  **Frontend (Streamlit):** Handles user interaction, image uploads, and rendering of detection results.
2.  **Backend (FastAPI):** Receives images via API, processes them through the YOLOv8 engine, and returns structured JSON data.
3.  **Model (YOLOv8):** Optimized with **C2f modules** and **Anchor-Free detection** for superior performance on small-scale industrial defects.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
Validated on the DeepPCB dataset:
* **Precision:** 95.47%
* **Recall:** 94.02%
* **mAP50:** 95.03%
* **mAP50-95:** 90.62%

🛡️ Challenges & Solutions
Small Target Detection: Utilized the YOLOv8 C2f backbone to preserve spatial features for minute defects like "spurs."

Process Efficiency: Implemented an asynchronous FastAPI service to ensure the UI remains responsive during heavy batch inference.

Data Management: Developed a ZIP-export feature to provide manufacturers with an immediate, organized audit trail of all inspections.
